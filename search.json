Using grammar simChef, can investigate question adding vary_across component Experiment. example, varying sigma (.e,. noise level) parameter Linear Gaussian DGP across four different values (.e,. 1, 2, 4, 8) keeping parameters fixed baseline value. generally, add_vary_across() can used vary across one parameters DGP Method keeping parameters fixed baseline value. inputs add_vary_across follows: Note: one .dgp .method can specified time. vary across one DGP /Method, use separate add_vary_across() call . [param_name] name argument/parameter DGP/Method function varied. [param_values] vector list values [param_name] take , arguments kept constant baseline value (see DGP$dgp_params Method$method_params baseline values). notes varying across multiple parameters: E.g., add_vary_across(.dgp = \"Linear Gaussian DGP\", sigma = c(1, 2, 4, 8), n = c(100, 200, 300)) result \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) distinct configurations DGP. E.g., add_vary_across(.dgp = \"Linear Gaussian DGP\", sigma = c(1, 2, 4, 8)) %>% add_vary_across(.method = \"OLS\", cols = c(\"X1\", \"X2\")) results 8 DGP-method combinations fitted Experiment (4 variations DGP \\(\\times\\) 2 variations Method). However, run experiment, results quite want. fit_results yields tibble 40 rows (= 10 replicates \\(\\times\\) 4 DGP variations \\(\\times\\) 1 Method) desired, evaluation results eval_results summarized/aggregated across values sigma.  see different values sigma impact OLS results, need modify Evaluator Visualizer functions. Specifically, reject_prob_fun(), want group fit_results sigma addition .dgp_name .method_name. , can manually set group_vars <- c(\".dgp_name\", \".method_name\", \"sigma\"). However, better practice make use input argument named vary_params like . run experiment (via run_experiment()), vary_params auto-filled vector parameter names varied (.e., added via add_vary_across()). case, vary_params auto-filled c(\"sigma\"). Thus, using vary_params argument, Evaluator work generally, even parameters besides sigma varied Experiment. Similarly power_plot_fun(), need add vary_params input argument plot results across different values sigma.

Added “Setting simulation” vignette recommendations creating simulation projects use simChef (https://github.com/Yu-Group/simChef/pull/152). Added helper function create_sim() initializing simulation project run_tests() running testthat tests user’s custom simulation functions (https://github.com/Yu-Group/simChef/pull/155). Made quality life improvements library Evaluator/Vizualizer helper functions (https://github.com/Yu-Group/simChef/pull/158). default Visualizer plotting theme now ggplot, can now changed globally using simChef.plot_theme option, e.g., get previous default use options(simChef.plot_theme = \"vthemes\") (https://github.com/Yu-Group/simChef/pull/161). https://github.com/Yu-Group/simChef/pull/129 https://github.com/Yu-Group/simChef/pull/134","code":""}]
