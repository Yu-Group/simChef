To examine the power of the test, we plot the rejection probability as a function of $\alpha$, that is, $\mathbb{P}(\text{p-value} \leq \alpha)$ vs. $\alpha$. If the coefficient is non-zero in the underlying DGP, then a larger AUC would indicate better performance in terms of the power. We will primarily focus on plotting the power of the first coefficient $\beta_1$.

	[In practice, documentation of the plotters should answer the questions “what” and “why”. That is, “what” is the plot, and “why” are we using/studying it? As this simulation experiment is a contrived example, we omit the “why” here.]
