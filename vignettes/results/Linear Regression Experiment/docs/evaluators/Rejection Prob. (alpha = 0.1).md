We define the rejection probability as the proportion of repetitions in the simulation experiment that result in a p-value $\leq \alpha$. Here, we choose to set the significance level $\alpha = 0.1$.

	[In practice, documentation of evaluation metrics should answer the questions “what” and “why”. That is, “what” is the metric, and “why” are we using/studying it? As this simulation experiment is a contrived example, we omit the “why” here.]
