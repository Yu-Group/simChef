We recommend initializing your simulation directory as you would any new
analysis: using a project. Doing so improves reproducibility and replicability;
it keeps your code, data, and outputs are neatly separated from other analyses.
In the same vein, we *highly* encourage the use of version control software ---
[git](https://git-scm.com/) in particular. It helps you keep track of changes,
undo snafus, and seamlessly collaborate with your peers.

Your git repositories can be linked to [GitHub](https://github.com/), a hosting
service that lets you manage your projects. If you're unfamiliar with git or
GitHub, or haven't yet set git up on you machine, we suggest reviewing Chapters
4 through 8 of [*Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).

While you could create a version-controlled R project manually, we suggest using
the `create_sim()` function. Briefly, this function takes as argument a `path`
indicating the location of the new directory for your simulation study and
creates the necessary folders and files. It also initializes a new project and a
git repository. This repository can optionally be linked to GitHub using, for
example,
[`usethis::use_github()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html).
If you don't want to use git, set `create_sim()`'s `init_git` argument can to
`FALSE`.

After creating your project with `create_sim()`, you'll find the following
directories and files at the designated `path`:

- `R/`: This folder will contain your simulation study's R code.
  - `meal.R`: Your `simChef` experiment is assembled in this file.
  - `dgp/`: Data-generating process functions are stored here.
  - `method/`: Method functions are stored here.
  - `eval/`: Evaluator functions are stored here.
  - `viz/`: Visualizer functions are stored here.
- `results/`: Your simulation experiment's output are automatically saved here.
- `README.md`: This markdown file briefly summarizes your simulation study's
  goals and results. Some guidance on navigating your project's directory
  structure might also be appreciated by your collaborators --- and even
  yourself at some point in the future.

The optional directories and files listed below are generated by setting
`create_sim()`'s `tests` argument to `TRUE`, which is its default.

- `tests/`: Unit tests promote high-quality code by ensuring that your many
  functions operate as expected. Your simulation study's results are in turn
  more trustworthy. We recommend using the
  [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) R package's suite of unit testing
  tools, and including the following files and sub-directories:
  - `testthat.R`: This script should call `testthat::test_dir()` on the
    following sub-directories to run the tests contained therein.
  - `testthat/dgp-tests/`: Tests for data-generating process functions.
  - `testthat/method-tests/`: Tests for method functions.
  - `testthat/eval-tests/`: Tests for evaluator functions.
  - `testthat/viz-tests/`: Tests for visualizer functions.
  
Similarly, directories for organizing high-power computing-related files can be
generated by setting `hpc = TRUE` when calling `create_sim()`:

- `scripts/`: We recommend running resource-intense simulation studies on
  high-performance computing environments with workload managers, like
  [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). Bash scripts for doing
  so can be saved here. For added flexibility, we recommend the R package
  [`optparse`](https://github.com/trevorld/r-optparse) to parse command-line
  options from your bash scripts within `meal.R`.
- `logs/`: The files output by these workload managers can be stored in this
  directory.

Again with reproducibility and replicability in mind, we encourage the use of
[`renv`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/index.html) for
project-local dependency management. `renv` can be initialized when creating
your project by setting `init_renv = TRUE` in your call to `create_sim()`. The
general `renv` workflow can be found
[here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

Of course, this project structure, as well as the names of directories and
files, are nothing but suggestions. Feel free to organize your simulation study
as best you see fit. You might find some inspiration
