\arguments{
\item{dgp}{A \code{DGP} object.}

\item{evaluator}{An \code{Evaluator} object.}

\item{experiment}{An \code{Experiment} object.}

\item{future.globals}{Character vector of names in the global environment to
pass to parallel workers. Passed as the argument of the same name to
\code{future.apply::future_lapply} and related functions. To set for all
runs of the experiment, use the same argument during initialization.}

\item{future.packages}{Character vector of packages required by parallel
workers. Passed as the argument of the same name to
\code{future.apply::future_lapply} and related functions. To set for all
runs of the experiment, use the same argument during initialization.}

\item{future.seed}{Passed as the argument of the same name in
\code{future.apply::future_apply}.}

\item{method}{A \code{Method} object.}

\item{n_reps}{The number of replicates of the \code{Experiment} for this run.}

\item{parallel_strategy}{A vector with some combination of "reps", "dgps", or
"methods". Determines how computation will be distributed across available
resources. Default is "reps".}

\item{save}{If \code{TRUE}, save outputs to disk.}

\item{use_cached}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, find and return previously saved
results. If cached results cannot be found, continue as if
\code{use_cached} was \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Level of verbosity. Default is 1, which prints out messages
after major checkpoints in the experiment. If 0, no messages are printed.}

\item{visualizer}{A \code{Visualizer} object.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
