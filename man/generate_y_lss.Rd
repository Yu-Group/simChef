\title{Generate locally spiky smooth (LSS) response data.}
\usage{
generate_y_lss(
  X,
  k,
  s,
  thresholds = 1,
  signs = 1,
  betas = 1,
  intercept = 0,
  overlap = FALSE,
  err = NULL,
  return_support = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Design data matrix of observed variables.}

\item{k}{Order of the interactions.}

\item{s}{Number of interactions in the LSS model or a matrix of the support
indices with each interaction taking a row in this matrix and ncol = k.}

\item{thresholds}{A scalar or a s x k matrix of the thresholds for each term
in the LSS model.}

\item{signs}{A scalar or a s x k matrix of the sign of each interaction
(1 means > while -1 means <).}

\item{betas}{Scalar or parameter vector for interaction terms.}

\item{intercept}{Scalar intercept term.}

\item{overlap}{If TRUE, simulate support indices with replacement; if FALSE,
simulate support indices without replacement (so no overlap)}

\item{err}{Function from which to generate simulate error vector. Default
is \code{NULL} which adds no error to the response y.}

\item{return_support}{Logical specifying whether or not to return a vector
of the support column names. If \code{X} has no column names, then the
indices of the support are used.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to err() to generate the error vector.}
}
\value{
A response vector of length nrow(X).
}
\description{
Generate LSS response data with a specified error
distribution given the observed data matrices.
